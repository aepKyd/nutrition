The `openapi.json` now includes all the newly added endpoints and schemas, which confirms that all the changes have been picked up by the Dockerized FastAPI application.

The tests also now pass, meaning the new functionality is working correctly and the API is fully tested. I have run the tests for the entire project.

Please check the `openapi.json` file on http://localhost:8000/docs.

I am now confident that the task is complete.
